### M6.2 Directive Definition Object
Create a directive definition object (DDO) on `ntFakeVideo`.

Add a `template` property to the DDO to define the markup for `ntFakeVideo`.
// Elaborate. What is the markup supposed to look like?

Add a `scope` property to the DDO to reads the values off of the HTML attributes.
